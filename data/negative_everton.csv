433,shame they ran out of steam amp lost couple of games late in season like everton at home newcastle away and the chelsea game or they couldve been looking at champions league i watched this with my own eyes and still don t believe keane kept up with him if spurs lose and arsenal or everton win they don t even get europe i m dying everton are losing to city and spurs are losing to leicester arsenal might actually qualify for this crumble you were certs for top 4 according to you lot not long back epic let down why do absolute dog shit teams like burnley west brom fulham everton and the like cause utter chaos against better teams,"[('burnley', 0.4408), ('everton', 0.4516), ('everton win', 0.4542), ('keane', 0.4857), ('burnley west brom fulham everton', 0.5329)]"
434,if it was any other club we could already be getting the passports out but a leicester home defeat and everton getting a 9 0 away win against the champions is exactly the soof shit that would happen to west ham godfrey is player of the year the overpaid crap can do one and leave damn braga killed u to me it was everton game same everton that lost to sheffield united everton thinking the only way we will get champions league is if the 6 get points deducted well just like your chances of winning anything sometime soon itll never happen means everton can t get in the europa league now from champions in october to this he really is a giant muppet,"[('europa league', 0.4321), ('everton game', 0.4533), ('champions league', 0.4772), ('everton', 0.5219), ('united everton', 0.5614)]"
435,but realistically everton arent getting a win at city so most likely we play europa conference which we should totally look to avoid fuck off youre joking so hammers 12 5 1 everton 1 amp hammers 13 5 1 brighton could overtake spuds and still finish out of the europa conference if everton finishes higher im so confused by how this all works now i am just not positive that we would make europe spurs and everton play tough matches but we will take advantage i hate the fact that we now have our fate in other peoples hands another crap season everton no europe yet again 450 million speant im in management i would be sacked straight off this is whats wrong at everton poor recruitment in management next year will be no change believe me more misery,"[('everton amp', 0.4448), ('everton', 0.5633), ('everton play', 0.6234), ('season everton', 0.6308), ('crap season everton', 0.6665)]"

437,i am thinking on sunday both spurs and everton will lose and we will mess up am i being pessimistic or realistic may the least shit team win so we ve had the worst season in years some would say and somehow we are still clear of everton and 5 points behind united we are so big sadly john the premier league will do nothing and small teams like our everton wi worryingly tottenham need to lose by 17 more goals than everton do to avoid qualifying for that europa conference nonsense the last pl game where the opposition gk didn t make a save was i don t have any sympathy if we get uefa conference league if we simply beat everton burnley or fulham at home we woul,"[('premier league', 0.4337), ('spurs', 0.4425), ('everton', 0.4517), ('everton burnley', 0.4824), ('tottenham', 0.4884)]"
438,probably got put off by everyone at everton begging for a points deduction if we dont invest asap a european tour could be our doom next season imagine if the brighton v city game was the everton match instead the fucking scenes carra being a liverpool representative is the biggest myth ever man he literally supports everton i m tired of this guy bei i said over and over we never needed thiago but everton fans said over and over he was shite how wrong was we both laa city lost to brighton they are all honed in on the champions league final and everton always give them problems losing to everton was our season basically only a everton card fucked my multi of 50 odd okay everton game denied me on both tickets wow,"[('everton card', 0.4965), ('everton', 0.5033), ('everton game', 0.5242), ('odd okay everton game', 0.5329), ('everton fans', 0.5543)]"

440,i think everton and leicester will end up very disappointed with their final positions given their position for 90 of the season i fully expect everton to finish 10th and leicester 5th huge blow for leicester who ve had champions league in their hands for 2 seasons now can t stop thinking about how if everton had won their last game they d be competing with west ham for a potential europe place but they ended up losing 1 0 at home to fucking sheffield united how assna is sneaking its way to europe epl is a predictable league 8th mate no way city don t beat everton but lets be honest how cares the bastards have drained me i d rather be an everton supporter than live in ghana and try to make fun at people,"[('champions league', 0.3608), ('predictable league', 0.3706), ('sheffield united', 0.4113), ('everton supporter', 0.5193), ('everton', 0.5768)]"

443,lpool red stain council tenants everton and thfc all have to win four do and one loses it s so predictable sadly john the premier league will do nothing and small teams like our everton will forever be discriminated against great but unfortunately it didnt matter at the end everton spent fuck all recently then jay why so bitter spurs loose draw and everton win and then we won t get europa conference what the fuck are you talking about he is never and never will be an everton player oh am tired literally fuck off,"[('everton player', 0.4799), ('everton', 0.5199), ('end everton', 0.5341), ('everton win', 0.5495), ('red stain council tenants everton', 0.5586)]"
444,even with holgate in the backline james just doesnt want to back track brilliant going forward but if we keep sitting back hell be fatigued from defending constantly this is probably the reason hes injured a lot since he played for a lot of attacking teams shit arsenal could easily finish 7th and qualify for that bloody conference league something reassuringly sad about everton fans obsession with a team that is a different level and has been for 35 years i m actually on my knees for arsenal to not finish 7th that europa conference is a disgrace i don t want to be anywhere near it let everton have it ffs,"[('teams shit arsenal', 0.3213), ('backline james', 0.3715), ('everton', 0.3832), ('everton fans', 0.4181), ('everton fans obsession', 0.4519)]"
445,another poor performance at home but this time with a result largely down to michael keanes display spurs will get dicked at leicester clubs in turmoil cant see us getting anything at city so dont be surprised if arsenal get 7th and the uefa conference league spot everton arent beating city unfortunately obviously everton lose to man city and potterball is too much for arteta of course genuinely be stuck in the battle for top half with everton and west ham when kane goes sad times can this season just end now i ve had enough,"[('michael keanes display', 0.4409), ('arsenal', 0.4428), ('everton', 0.444), ('uefa conference league spot everton', 0.4855), ('arsenal get', 0.502)]"
