179,you really can t play the game fairly anymore can you games gone that s a pen i think that non penalty for bamford is the most enraging decision this season so far what s the point of var ludicrous var punishes bamford for not falling clear and obvious penalty f var clear penalty for bamford there exactly what is for carry on diving fucking joke of a ref he s lost balance and the chance to score as soon as he s past the gk fucking five next time keeper clips bamford and he stays on his feet no penalty if he goes down he definitely gets a penalty officials are just encouraging players to dive disgraceful,"[('penalty', 0.4954), ('clear penalty', 0.5026), ('obvious penalty', 0.5066), ('penalty var', 0.528), ('next time keeper clips bamford', 0.579)]"
180,and theres is the problem if he goes down its a penalty why cant var go back and retrospectively give a penalty punished for honesty absoulute joke the game get punished for being honest absolute joke unfortunately with these inept refs you do premier league football with substandard referees that s why players dive because bamford makes every effoto stay on his feet it s not even checked by var stone wall penalty absolute shambles i swear im watching the saints v leeds game why am i getting coverage of man united when its on the other channel ffs instead bamfords lying on the floor possibly concussed sounds about right games fucked the gall of this crowd to boo bamfords head injury after the sportsmanship he showed to stay on his feet when mccarthy brought him down,"[('referees', 0.3908), ('inept refs', 0.4318), ('penalty', 0.4354), ('substandard referees', 0.4629), ('var stone wall penalty', 0.4677)]"
181,spot on there s absolutely no reason to incentivise players to go down in situations like these var should ensure they get the penalty either way poor refereeing so do you have to go down for it to count as a foul how the fuck does that even make sense genuinely fuming at that rule var should be saying it s a penalty if you get punched in the face and carry on will they not look at it unbelievable how we haven t got a pen baffles me bamford gets taken and stays on his feet no pen but if he throws himself to the floor like an olympic diver he would have fix the rules apparently cheats do prosper its the only way you can get a penalty stay on your feet and it doesnt count,"[('rule var', 0.3815), ('refereeing', 0.4172), ('foul', 0.4621), ('poor refereeing', 0.4903), ('penalty', 0.5123)]"
182,if the pl want to stamp out diving var need to go back and give that as penalty obviously the fa are happy with diving and cheating he s right and that s so annoying clear contact with mccarthy that knocks him off his stride if he goes to ground it s a pen so frustrating and exactly why diving is so prevalent leeds robbed there bamford is clipped by keeper and stays on feet no pen given you have to dive for penalties thats what is wrong with football bamford doesnt go down after the goalkeeper makes contact with him and its then not given as a penalty they wonder why players dive or go down easy you get zero for being honest thats just proved it,"[('diving', 0.4086), ('penalties', 0.4128), ('football bamford', 0.435), ('penalty', 0.4395), ('diving var', 0.5008)]"
183,that is a blatent blatent pen the fact he didnt go down and do six rolls shouldnt matter that makes a mockery of the whole being against going to ground easily argument bamford fouled there by the mccarthy but because he stayed up he didn t get a penalty joke they ve killed patrick bamford anywhere else on the pitch that gets brought back for a freekick so why isnt it a penalty players lauded all the time for clever play code for cheating but if youre honest you get punished ridiculous bamford should have scored that but var officials useless punished for not falling to the ground when paddy was being honest even tho it would of been a pen embarrassing,"[('patrick bamford', 0.4388), ('penalty joke', 0.4533), ('penalty players', 0.463), ('penalty', 0.4749), ('ridiculous bamford', 0.5035)]"
184,i dont understand how var dont look at the bamford challenge just because he hasnt gone down its still a foul what a load of shit bamford should have lobbed that but if he went to ground it s a pen being too honest gets you nowhere just encouraging diving now evidence there why players dive simple as that get fuckall for honesty players need to be awarded for honesty thats a penalty if paddy goes down shocking if they dont give penalties in that situation theyre basically telling all players theyve got to dive to force the issue var is a fucking joke no scrap that the guys using var are a fucking joke another example of why the game is gone why cant they give a pen if someone doesnt go down,"[('dive', 0.3516), ('penalties', 0.3667), ('bamford challenge', 0.3735), ('foul', 0.3743), ('penalty', 0.3896)]"

187,don t agree with that it should be a pen to leeds however leeds should have at least another 2 yellows how can var not give that as a penalty cant var bring that back and award the penalty not getting a penalty because bamford tried to stay on his feet instead of going down embarrassing from the referee clear penalty and that is why players dive bamford has been down for a while with what looked like a head injury at that right there is why players go down in the box bamfords honesty is endearing but by christ is he never rewarded for it proof that you now have to dive to get a penalty poor refereeing fucking pathetic bamford dives and he gets a penalty because he stays on his feet we get nothing absolutely flawed system,"[('leeds', 0.4004), ('penalty', 0.4149), ('clear penalty', 0.422), ('poor refereeing', 0.4283), ('fucking pathetic bamford dives', 0.5403)]"

189,ridiculous var a fouls a foul shouldnt have to fall over to get the penalty why does var not check it how is that not a penalty you have to go down to get the decision get punished for staying on your feet this is why players dive and go down softly meanwhile djenepo and walker peters are chucking themselves to the ground at every opportunity bamford penalised for not going down amp trying to stay on his feet clear penalty awful referees as usual fucking joke thats not been given just because he stayed up and people wonder why players dive and that everybody is what is wrong with football var must have gone for a piss there penalty all day long that this ref is absolutely fucking terrible punished for being honest ridiculous,"[('penalty', 0.4477), ('clear penalty', 0.4602), ('ridiculous var', 0.464), ('foul', 0.4677), ('awful referees', 0.4863)]"
