435,yeah sure bring on 2 strikers in the last 5 minutes to grab a draw instead of bringing on a defender earlier to protect a goal lead i like deano but his use of subs is by far the worst ive ever seen too easy for us up until the first goal then we have lulled in 1st gear its been hard for us to raise the performance after lowering it the game was there to be dominated by us we just havent fancied doing so today s game shows how our team falls apawithout mings and his leadership people that don t rate mings are honestly brain dead nswe are unlikely to be impressed with this,"[('mings', 0.2822), ('nswe', 0.2879), ('goal lead', 0.3193), ('strikers', 0.356), ('deano', 0.369)]"
